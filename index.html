          My name is Leila, and Iâ€™m an independent, diligent woman who loves to learn new things.I graduated from the university with a major in software engineering, and I presented my thesis in the field of Self-healing systems.The technology field has always been appealing to me, and I have always tried learning and educating myself on new techniques and innovations. I have high perseverance in my field of studies.After graduating from university, I mainly worked as a software analyst, and then I became the project manager with the agile approach.as a scrum master. Although I have never worked as a programmer before, it is what I have always wanted to do and be able to create applications which is usable.As a woman, I have always wanted to be effective and influential in the technology field and considering my strong desire for the field, I will work hard and provide my best effort in succeeding in this pathway of becoming a professional. I think getting to the programming field gives me more motivation to improve my creativity and be as beneficial as possible.For every programmer curiosity and the urge of being good at something is always the motivation. If you know why you want to learn web development, go challenge yourself, that is motivation enough. For me, programming fascinated me in the aspect of all the programs and applications you can make with it.

I love traveling and swimming, and I look forward to becoming a lifeguard one day. I read books related to personal growth and development in my free time, and I love spending time with my friends. 

My goals in the future are to become a freelance programmer, travel to as many places as I can, and follow my lifestyle. I believe setting up goals gives us more motivation and power to move forward in life, and this is what I have chosen to do.
